//! A stupidly simple SRT subtitles parser/renderer
//!
//! ## The Gist
//!
//! The main entrypoints into this API are [`from_str()`] and [`to_string()`]. Both of
//! those deal with a sequence of [`Subtitle`]s that can be manipulated to your
//! heart's content
//!
//! ## Quickstart
//!
//! Here's a simple example that
//!
//! 1. Parses some SRT text
//! 2. Removes the first and last entry
//! 3. Shifts all the timestamps up by 500ms
//! 4. Renders back to SRT text
//!
//! ```rust
//! const SAMPLE_SRT_TEXT: &str = "\
//! 1
//! 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
//! Will be removed
//!
//! 2
//! 00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
//! Will be kept
//!
//! 3
//! 00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,750
//! Will also be removed
//! ";
//!
//! // 1. Parses some SRT text
//! let subtitles = kiss_srt::from_str(SAMPLE_SRT_TEXT).unwrap();
//! // 2. Removes the first and last entry
//! let mut middle = match subtitles.as_slice() {
//!     [_, middle @ .., _] => middle.to_owned(),
//!     _ => panic!("Needs at least two entries"),
//! };
//!
//! // 3. Shifts all the timestamps up by 500ms
//! for subtitle in &mut middle {
//!     subtitle.start += kiss_srt::Duration::from_millis(500);
//! }
//!
//! // 4. Renders back to SRT text
//! const PRUNED_AND_SHIFTED: &str = "\
//! 1
//! 00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
//! Will be kept
//! ";
//! assert_eq!(kiss_srt::to_string(&middle), PRUNED_AND_SHIFTED);
//! ```
//!
//! Let's take a moment to appreciate how simple this was
//!
//! We didn't have to worry about shifting the IDs to make it start at one again (it
//! just gets inferred from the index), and we didn't have to worry about shifting
//! both the start and end timestamp because the subtitles use a start and
//! _duration_ instead
//!
//! There is beauty in simplicity ðŸ’•
